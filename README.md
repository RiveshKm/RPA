My projects related to Robotic Process Automation


> In the web scraping project, the robot will scrap data from a hotel and leisure deals site.
It will store it in an excel sheet which can be found in the 'Data' folder.

> In the clothes_consultant project, the robot will advise the user which types of clothes to wear depending on the location provided.
It will search for the weather stats of that specific location and then it will analyse it.
